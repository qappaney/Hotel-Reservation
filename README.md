# Hotel Reservation
This project delivers a comprehensive End-to-End Reporting Insight Solution, starting from robust Database Design and extending through the full data lifecycle to actionable business intelligence. It focuses on building a scalable and efficient Hotel Management System Database that supports both day-to-day operations and strategic decision-making.

The schema is designed to capture and organize all essential aspects of hotel management, including:

Guest Management: Personal data, loyalty program tracking, and contact details.

Room Inventory: Room types, capacity, rates, and real-time availability status.

Reservation Tracking: Full lifecycle of reservations with detailed check-in/check-out information.

Staff and Services: Management of employees, their roles, shifts, and service offerings.

Billing and Payments: Comprehensive financial tracking for all transactions.

Service Utilization: Recording guest interactions with hotel services for analysis and personalization.

The foundation of this system is a normalized relational model, optimized for performance and data integrity. Beyond just storing information, this architecture supports powerful ETL pipelines (SSIS), analytical models (SSAS), and interactive reporting (SSRS) â€” enabling a true end-to-end BI solution that turns raw data into strategic insights.
